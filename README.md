# Game

Players start with a Pickaxe and another tool (e.g., Weapon or Shield).
Players can cycle through tools using Q/E (Player 1) and Shift/Enter (Player 2).
The active tool is highlighted in the inventory UI.




Tool Mechanics:

Pickaxe: Removes blocks on the map when clicked.
Weapon: Pushes opponents away to knock them off the map.



Next Steps
Expand Tools:
Add more items like a "Trap" (places a block) or "Bomb" (destroys multiple blocks).
Health System:
Players have health points that decrease when hit by weapons or fall off the map.
Resource Collection:
Players can mine blocks to gather resources and craft new tools.
